## Building your project

```bash
npm run build
```

This command will build your project to a minified bundle to `out/rp2.js`. This is also a sourcemap for future possibilities of debugging.

## Deploy your project

```bash
npm run flash
```

Building and deploying your project can be achieved by running the flash npm command. Make sure you have your Pico connected.
