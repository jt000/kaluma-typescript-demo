# Kaluma Typescript Demo

[!NOTE] 
This demo utilizes the `@types\kaluma` definitions located in [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped) repo. At the time of writing this readme, it is awaiting the initial checkin in [PR #67850](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/pull/67850). This demo will not be functional until that PR has been completed.

This repo demonstrates how to utilize Typescript for writing your KalumaJS projects.
